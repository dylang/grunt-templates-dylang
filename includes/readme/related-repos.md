## About the Author

Hello fellow developer! My name is [Dylan Greene](https://github.com/dylang). When
not overwhelmed with my two kids I enjoy contributing to the open source community.
I'm a tech lead at [Opower](http://opower.com). I lead a team using Grunt and Angular to build software that
successfully helps people like us use less power.
Not too long ago I co-created [Doodle or Die](http://doodleordie.com), a hilarious web game with millions of
doodles that won us Node Knockout for the "most fun" category.
I'm [dylang](https://twitter.com/dylang) on Twitter and other places.

Some of my other Node projects:

| Name | Description | Github Stars | Npm Installs |
|---|---|--:|--:|{% _.each(repos, function(repo) {%}
| [`{%= repo.name %}`]({%= repo.url
%}) | {%= repo.description
%} | {%= repo.stars > 10 ? number(repo.stars) : '_New!_'
%} | {%= repo.stars > 0 ? number(repo.downloads)  : '_TBD_'
%} |{% }); %}
